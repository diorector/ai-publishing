# INTRODUCTION

# THE STARTUP CHEAT CODE

U
niversal truths we learn by age twelve:
## 1. Never feed a mogwai after midnight.

## 2. Breakfast cereal DOES taste better if you substitute chocolate

milk.
3. (And most relevant to our story . . .) The first time you play a new
video game, you’ll suck.
The controls are foreign. The game mechanics are inscrutable.
Make it through level one, and level two will undoubtedly get you. But
that second time around, you’ll do better. And if you play for a few
hours or a few days, you’ll start to feel the flow— eventually, you’re
unstoppable. In the zone. A juggernaut of win. THE RULER OF
YOUR CASTLE (though in this case, the castle is probably your par-
ents’ basement). But even if it’s your first time playing, there’s a way to
jump ahead of the learning curve: cheat codes.
Starting a business works this same way. The first time you build
# LOST AND FOUNDER

a company, it’s scary as hell. Accounting? Payroll? Customer acquisi-
tion? Recruiting? Hiring? Fundraising? People management? No won-
der fi rst- time founders, like fi rst- time gamers, die on the first level.
Customers won’t pay. Employees quit. Your investors make your COO
your boss, then fire you. You will very much want to retreat into a
basement and play video games for several long hours, possibly years.
The good news: there’s a cheat code here, too.
In my third year as a fi rst- time, what- the- hell-am-I-doing CEO, I
got an email from a Seattle entrepreneur I deeply respected, inviting
me to join a local group of startup movers and shakers at a local bar.
When I arrived, I was introduced to a handful of people whose names
I knew from the startup news websites and blogs I followed. These
were founders and technologists I’d read about but never thought I’d
meet— basically the coolest nerds in my universe. I played it cool. We
drank. We talked. Well, they mostly talked; I mostly listened.
What I heard shattered my l ong- held illusions about startup life.
These men and women were scared, just like me. They were un-
certain. They struggled, they felt fear. They needed help. Those who’d
been through an experience gave advice and offered assistance to the
first-timers. The longer we stayed and the more we drank, the more
vulnerability emerged. No one pretended to have all the answers, but
when someone had insight, they opened up.
When I got home, I tipsily typed an email to myself with some of
what we’d talked about. I stared at it, trying to figure out if it was
possible to avoid the pitfalls, a way to not suck the first time around.
Here are some of the more tactical takeaways I learned that night
(apart from four Tom Collinses are one too many):
• Raising prices for your product every year or two and grandfather-
ing in existing customers is a great way to increase loyalty and
# THE STARTUP CHEAT CODE

grow your profit margins. (We did this several times over the next
few years; it worked like a charm.)
• If you want to raise money from an investor, ask for help with your
business. If you want an investor to help with your business, ask for
money. (From later experiences I can verify that, yes, this totally
works.)
• Many voting rights for funded companies have some provision that
gives special consideration to “preferred shareholders.” Usually,
these are the investors, but smart entrepreneurs know this and thus
will buy a small amount of preferred shares in their own companies
during a funding round so they will also share these rights.
• The Hacker News website (https:// news.ycombinator.com) has an
algorithm that filters out high quantities of votes from a single ge-
ography. So if you want to ask your friends to help up-vote some-
thing to page 1, make sure they’re not all in the same city. (Also,
make friends in other cities.)
• Recruiting for software engineers is best done directly by found-
ers. Find people who look interesting, uncover a connection you
have to them in your network, get an intro, meet for coffee, get
them excited about your company, and if they’re not interested, ask
who they know who might be. Not one of the group’s members had
success with external recruiters (at least, not in the early stages).
Oh, and Craigslist still works way better than most of the other job
sites, at least in Seattle.
How did these entrepreneurs acquire this knowledge? How did
they have answers to questions I didn’t even know I should be asking?
The answer: they had startup cheat codes. (Sadly, it’s not as easy
as the Konami code.)
The hard way to earn those codes is experience. You struggle
# LOST AND FOUNDER

through a problem, follow conventional wisdom until you prove it’s
not working, make all sorts of mistakes, and then, eventually, stumble
onto a solution that succeeds. It’s agonizing, but sometimes it’s the
only path available.
The cheat is to have connections to people— mentors, advisers,
friends, family, partners, employees— who’ve been through the prob-
lems you’re facing before and can give you a map out of the woods and
onto a path that works. You need to be willing to listen. You need a
network whose problems and solutions match. But when you can
short- circuit the painful quagmire of stumbling through an issue
alone, it’s gold.
That’s one of the biggest things I’ve learned about startups: it’s
dangerous to go alone. You want people around you who’ve been
through this before and are willing to openly share their experiences.
That’s why second- and third- time entrepreneurs have such bet-
ter track records than their fi rst- time peers. And why investors are so
much more likely to back a founder who’s been through the game at
least once before.
This book is one really long cheat code. I wrote it so that you don’t
have to repeat the mistakes I’ve made. So you can leapfrog the wasted
months, the wasted cash, and the heartache too many of us endure.
So that if you don’t live in a geography with lots of other startup
founders, you can still get the inside scoop. To unlock these cheat
codes, you’ll need context, stories, data, and thorough explanations.
And I won’t share just the tactical tips and tricks; I have to include the
ugly, heartbreaking realities, too. If I held back out of fear or a desire
to make myself or my company look better than it is, I’d be failing
you. That’s why this book is so transparent about the things founders
don’t normally discuss. Money. Depression. Layoffs. Failure.
I’ll tell you how I turned down a l ife- changing acquisition and
# THE STARTUP CHEAT CODE

how I regret it to this day (hell, I’ll even show you the email). I’ll walk
through how we raised money and explore why it’s so rarely the right
move (and why it may even have been wrong for us). And I’ll show
why so much of classic, Silicon Valley–s tartup advice is flat- out
wrong, mangled by survivorship bias, and only applicable to a tiny
subset of companies and founders (even though it’s dispensed to ev-
eryone with one- size- fits- all uniformity).
The next seventeen chapters are here to dismantle the shady logic
born from the oversimplified, opaque stories of what startup success
looks like. Instead, I’ll share real stories, show real numbers, and offer
real solutions.
How the Valley Fooled Us All
The aggrandized archetype of the “startup founder” is powerful and
pervasive. These entrepreneurs pull themselves up from nothing and
create jobs, wealth, and world- changing tech despite their meager be-
ginnings.
It’s also total bullshit.
University of California– Berkeley economists analyzed shared
traits of entrepreneurs and found that, in reality, most come from
backgrounds of wealth and privilege. (I complain about having no
friends as a kid, but let’s be clear: I had a friggin’ Nintendo game con-
sole. In 1989. That’s basically the child equivalent of a free coke
hookup in the ’80s!)
But anyone can succeed in the gold rush of tech startups, right?
That’s the whole point, isn’t it?
Nope. Sorry. More BS. More than 75 percent of e arly- stage technol-
ogy companies fail to return their investors’ capital (nevermind make a
profit), according to a Harvard Business School cohort analysis. If we
# LOST AND FOUNDER

look at only t ech- centric, v enture- backed startups, it’s more than 90
percent! Even surviving the first few years was no guarantee of s uccess—
a full 50 percent of the companies still alive in year 4 went under.
Founders are usually young, just out of school, yeah? Nope. The
Kaufman Foundation found that most founders are between thirty-
five and forty- four years old, not the twentysomething college drop-
outs epitomized by popular culture.
If this data has you questioning the way you think about
startups . . . good. It should.
I hate these mythological stories for a personal reason: I spent a
decade pursuing this precise, vaunted myth of startup success and
went off the rails.
As a white, Jew(ish)* American dude, I’ve enjoyed a life of relative
wealth and privilege compared to 99 percent of the world. But I wasn’t
fated to or groomed to become a tech entrepreneur. I’m not a pro-
grammer. I didn’t go to an Ivy League school or a C omputer Science
program. My company wasn’t founded in Silicon Valley. When I
started, I didn’t know a single venture capitalist or any entrepreneurs
who’d raised money. I was never recruited into the startup or tech-
nology world.
Maybe the only correlation I’ve got with the vaunted startup-
founder myth is that I dropped out of college . . . mostly because I had
a fight with my dad, and he stopped paying my tuition. Does that
count?
Suffice it to say, I’m a pretty unlikely tech founder/ CEO. Yet
somehow, remarkably, accidentally, that’s exactly what I became.
### In 2001, I started working with my mom, Gillian, designing web-

*I’m ethnically Jewish (97 percent Ashkenazi, according to 23andMe), but not religious.
Bring on the bacon.
# THE STARTUP CHEAT CODE

sites for small businesses in the shadow of Microsoft’s suburban
Seattle- area campus. Side note: “Mom & Son Consultancy” is proba-
bly the least likely startup combination in this field; it raised plenty of
eyebrows along the way (after a while, I took to calling her by her first
name in work contexts— that helped). The dot- com bust and my
sorely lacking business acumen meant we struggled for years, but
eventually, after trial and error, missteps and heartache, tragedy and
triumph, I found myself CEO of a burgeoning software company,
complete with investors, employees, customers, and w rite- ups in
TechCrunch.
### By 2017, my company, Moz, was a $45 million/ year venture-

backed B2B software provider, creating products for professionals
who help their clients or teams with search engine optimization
(SEO). In layman’s terms, we make software for marketers. They use
our tools to help websites rank well in Google’s search engine, and as
Google became one of the world’s richest, most influential compa-
nies, our software rose to high demand.
Moz is neither an overnight, b illion- dollar success story nor a
tragic tale of failure. The technology and business press tend to cover
companies on one side or the other of this pendulum, but it’s my belief
that, for the majority of entrepreneurs and teams, there’s a great deal
to be learned from the highs and lows of a more middle-of- the- road
startup life cycle. Outliers like Facebook (on the wildly successful end
of the spectrum) or Secret* (on the opposite end) make for terrifically
interesting shock pieces, but neither is willing to disclose enough or,
perhaps, be s elf- reflective enough to provide great insight into the
*The social networking website Secret infamously raised $100 million in funding after six
months of stealth operations, of which the founders pocketed $25 million privately. A year
later, the company shut down after achieving zero traction with a nonexistent business
model.

subjects that bring value to those who’d follow in their footsteps (or
who try to avoid doing so).
This book intends to do exactly that by tackling tough subjects
through anecdotes, stats, and harsh self- inquiry. Admittedly, my per-
spective is biased by my experiences, my background, and my unique
view of the startup world as an employee, a CEO, and a board mem-
ber. I try to be as up front as possible about all of that. I believe that
to get the most from any singular experience, you need to know the
author’s journey and position. Given that perspective (via this intro-
duction), you can take my biases into account as we embark on this
examination of startups and entrepreneurship.
Moz is different from many of the most written- about tech start-
ups in a few ways I should mention:
• As a B2B company, our product is almost always marketed to and
purchased by companies and consultants rather than directly by
consumers. This is worth noting because the most visible and
written- about tech companies are usually consumer-facing, either
in software (like Facebook or Google) or physical products or ser-
vices (like Tesla or Airbnb).
• Our products are s elf- service, rather than sales driven. This means
anyone can, at any time, visit our website, enter their credit card, and
get full access to our software without ever talking to or interact-
ing with a person on our team (because, let’s be real: phone calls
are terrifying). This approach has been historically uncommon in
B2B, primarily because sales were viewed as critical to forming
relationships between businesses and a way to push through large,
expensive, ongoing contracts. Today, with the rise of web- enabled
delivery and a generation of business owners/ professionals more
comfortable with a hands- off, low- pressure sales approach, self-
# THE STARTUP CHEAT CODE

service B2B sales funnels are slowly on the rise (as evidenced by
companies like Slack, SurveyMonkey, Dropbox, or MailChimp).
• Moz is creating and serving a new market, rather than disrupting
an existing one. SEO software has been around since only the
mid- 2000s. We were one of the first providers (starting in 2007)
to offer it via a web subscription (versus downloadable, desktop
software), and one of the largest in our field (both by revenue and
by customers). As of this writing, we aren’t aware of any direct
competitors who are many multiples of our size, any whose stock
is publicly traded, or any who has massively more customers or
revenue.
But though we have some outlying attributes, Moz does have
many of the other features stereotypical to tech startups:
• We’ve raised funding from traditional venture capital firms (as of
2017, $29.1 million across three rounds).
• Nearly all of our revenue comes from software.
• We operate with relatively high gross margins (75 percent and
above).
• We employ very expensive, talented, highly-in-demand engineers,
product designers, marketers, and customer service folks. The av-
erage Moz salary is more than $100,000/ year, and with benefits
and taxes, a new employee costs us about $145,000/ year. More
than 70 percent of our costs come from the salaries and expenses
of people on the team.
• We’ve fluctuated over the years from burning cash in attempts to
grow faster versus staying profitable in order to limit risk (e.g.,
from 2014 to 2016 we consumed almost $20 million; as of 2017 we
were profitable again with more than $7 million in the bank).
# LOST AND FOUNDER

Since our founding in 2004, we’ve had some wild ups and downs.
We’ve survived boom and bust cycles, raising and spending venture
capital, making successful acquisitions and not-so-successful ones,
hiring sprees and layoffs, new product launches and product retire-
ments, and big changes in strategy.
### In 2014, after a particularly brutal period, I stepped aside as CEO

and took a role as an individual contributor. As of this writing, I’m
chairman of Moz’s board of directors and an adviser to several of our
product and marketing teams. I speak at more than thirty confer-
ences a year and spend about 25 percent of my days on the road, help-
ing folks around the world gain a better understanding of how search
engines and web- marketing channels work. I still walk to the office
from the apartment I share with my wife, Geraldine, run tests that
Google wishes I wouldn’t, try to be a force for transparency both in-
ternally and externally at Moz, and do my best not to beat myself up
for the mistakes of the past. (That last endeavor is the hardest.)
When I entered the startup world, I was predisposed to certain
ideas about what it meant to be CEO of a company like ours— early
stage, technology focused, rapid- growth seeking, and successful only
if we earned big returns for our shareholders and investors. We all
read the coverage of other startups and watch the TV shows and news
that purport to have windows into this reality. But years into my own
journey, I had a head- shaking, wait-a- minute- this- can’t-be-right awak -
ening. The media, the hype, the legends of how Silicon Valley startups
work are just a carefully crafted model home. They’re set pieces,
painted by interested parties for their own benefits, built to hide em-
barrassing flaws. None of it is real.
You don’t have to live, work, or start a company blinded, the way
I was, to reality.
# THE STARTUP CHEAT CODE

That’s why this book exists, and that’s why it’s organized into
tactical chapters, each unearthing the sometimes strange, hard-to-
comprehend, or rarely- talked- about truths of the startup world. These
chapters start with the common mythos epitomized by a famous
quote from a notable name in the technology world. You’ll see the
words of famous investors, wildly successful entrepreneurs, and es-
teemed authors and, piece by piece, see their falsehoods and false
impressions dismantled, first with stories of my own, and later
through data, research, and analysis. Each chapter ends with ideas or
tactics that have helped me (and sometimes others, too) overcome the
problems within. I don’t pretend to have all the answers. Not for a
second. But I often have tactics that helped me out of a bind, and if
they can help you, I’d kick myself for holding back.
So, get your controller. Insert your cartridge. It’s
B A SELECT and . . . let’s get started.
# CHAPTER 1

# THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE

(FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS)
You’ve got an interesting business, but we don’t believe it will ever
get past a few million dollars in revenue.
— Anonymous Investor I Pitched in 2009
I
n 2005, my coworker Matt and I were working in a r un- down, shared
office space above a noisy movie theater in Seattle when he walked
in. A hairy, b arrel- chested, fortysomething guy with gold chains, a
mean grimace, and a stack of papers in a folder stared down at me.
He asked, “Are you Rand Fishkin?”
I was twenty- five years old, disoriented by his arrival, intimidated
by his appearance and tone, and utterly panicked. I’m usually a terri-
ble liar, so was taken aback by how quickly a response left my mouth:
“Sorry, I don’t think he’s here.”
We exchanged a few more words, but I remember none of them.
My heart was pounding. I hated lying, but I also had no idea what
might happen if I identified myself. Matt just put on his headphones
# LOST AND FOUNDER

and pretended to be engrossed in whatever website he was working
on. When the extra from The Sopranos left, I called Gillian, president
of our three- person firm (who also happens to be my mom). I told her
about the unexpected visitor. She guessed he was a debt collector,
sent by one of the firms to whom a bank had sold our debt.
Oh, right. The debt. The $500,000 we owed, in my name, to fi-
nance our struggling consulting business.
Ten minutes after I returned to my apartment (actually, Geral-
dine’s a partment— I was unable to pay my half of rent with my some-
times tiny, sometimes nonexistent paychecks, and couldn’t pass a
credit check, either), I heard a knock on the door. Assuming it was
Geraldine carrying something she didn’t want to put down to turn
the key, I opened up without looking through the peephole.
It was the debt collector.
“Ha! Gotcha,” he said.
I was mute.
“You’re pretty good, kid. I totally bought that act today. . . .”
Scared senseless, I just stared at him.
He handed me the folder of papers I’d seen in his hands earlier
and said, “Rand Fishkin, you’ve been served.”
I couldn’t even reach out to take them. He dropped them on the
ground and walked away.
“Oops, I Accidentally a Startup”
In the summer of 2000, I was twenty- one with a year of college to go
at the University of Washington in Seattle. I’m one of those lucky kids
whose parents paid his tuition so he could “focus on his studies, not
on work.”
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
That is, until I got into a fight with my dad and he threatened to
cut me off. I was too prideful and stubborn to back down, apologize,
or reconcile, so, for the next two quarters, I had to pay my own way.
I worked part-time at the Wizards of the Coast Game Center, a
giant arcade, gaming events center, and retail shop around the corner
from campus. My $4.75/ hour salary was supplemented by buying
Pokémon cards with my employee discount and reselling them on
eBay and Craigslist for a tidy profit. I designed and built a few websites
on the side for some extra cash. And, thankfully, in the early 2000s,
college tuition hadn’t yet skyrocketed past the point of absurdity. A
full quarter, including books, only cost around $3,000—a sum I
scraped together while still managing to have enough to go out to the
movies, buy the occasional used video game, and pay the rent on my
small, shared apartment.
But two classes away from graduating, I threw in the towel. Part
of it was the cost, part of it was the lack of value I perceived from
school, but a lot of it was because of a failed romantic relationship
(long distance + breakup = broken heart). I wish I could say entrepre-
neurship was the catalyst for dropping out, but the truth is the other
way around. I wallowed in a little self- misery, watched a lot of X‑Files
reruns, and only then realized I needed something to do besides work
retail. Web design was my path of least resistance.
### In 1981, my mom, Gillian, started a marketing consultancy in Se-

attle, helping small businesses with their logos, Yellow Page ads, bro-
chures, and other print and advertising materials. In the late 1990s, her
clients started asking for websites, and she recruited me to learn
FrontPage, Dreamweaver, and HTML so I could help out. I liked the
work, and the extra money, and when I told my mom I wanted to work
with her full-time and not go back to college, she obliged.
# LOST AND FOUNDER

Over the summer of 2001, we dreamed big. Seattle’s tech scene
was booming in Microsoft’s backyard. Startups like Amazon, Kozmo,
and HomeGrocer dominated the local news. Everyone was switching
from slow, dial-up modems to high- speed broadband. We thought we
had an amazing opportunity to design sites for local businesses that
needed a presence on the soon-to-be-ubiquitous Internet. When the
dot- com crash hit, I barely noticed. Our clients still needed websites,
and I didn’t pay much attention to the falling prices, the late payments,
or the commoditization of web design.
For the next three years, we struggled against increasing compe-
tition, pervasive doubt about the web’s future, the challenges of get-
ting our clients to pay their bills on time, and, worst of all, our own
foolish beliefs about what would help our company grow. We were
trying to sell our services in a crowded marketplace without a com-
petitive differentiator. We wasted money on advertising that didn’t
bring in business. We leased high- priced office space, convinced that
an impressive building would help us close deals. We hired contrac-
tors and employees who didn’t work out. We rented booth space at
events that didn’t even pay for themselves. And, worst of all, we went
into debt to do it.
When I started working with my mom, she had a small amount
of debt on the business— less than $20,000 in total. But three years
later, we’d amassed an additional $100,000 of debt, much of it from
the aforementioned missteps. The great thing about a consulting
business is supposed to be the l ow- capital r equirements— smart op-
erators often make their consultancies profitable from day one. We
went the other direction, and in 2004, after we’d failed to secure yet
another client project we thought could put us on the path to success,
we defaulted.
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
It’s hard today to imagine the pre- 2008- financial- crisis world of
personal debt, where banks would extend loans of $ 50–$100,000 to
a college dropout with a tiny salary. At the time, credit card offers
arrived almost weekly, promising $10,000 limits that would quickly
rise to $15,000 or $20,000. Lending institutions were happy to offer
us lines of credit and equipment loans despite our meager track re-
cord and nonexistent collateral. Promotional interest rates in the < 2
percent range were available for the first two to three years of an ac-
count. Seduced by these offers and in desperate need of cash just to
make payroll and rent for three people, we went whole hog, racking
up a balance that eventually came back to bite us.
We took out loans and put them in my name because I had, at the
time, nothing to lose. My mom had her and my dad’s assets on the
line. They owned not only their home in Seattle’s suburbs but my
grandmother’s house in Connecticut as well, which could have also
been on the chopping block as collateral. So it was my social security
number and my signature on the loans— something that, at the time,
didn’t really scare me. Defaulting on these loans never really crossed
my mind.
Two of the most memorable days in my early career came that
fall, of 2004.
The first was on a Sunday. Gillian had told me and Matt, my
friend and our programmer, that we’d no longer be able to afford the
rent at our pricey high- rise office tower. Moving out was our only
option. We found a tiny shared office space in a r un- down part of
Seattle above an old movie theater for only a few hundred dollars a
month (versus the $2, 000- plus we had been paying), but we’d need to
break our lease. That meant the landlord could potentially hold our
equipment— including our computers, desks, chairs, and furniture— as

collateral. We had to get it out of the tower and over to the new space
fast, without anyone from the building noticing. This part’s straight
out of a movie.
Matt and I recruited a pair of friends— Marshall and Todd, a cou-
ple with two sets of big arms, strong backs, and a spacious truck to
whom we promised d inner—a nd quietly entered the building via the
loading garage.
We were halfway through loading up when the tower’s security
guard arrived. Cue heart falling into stomach.
After a brief, tense discussion on either side of our locked office
door, we had the guard make a phone call to Gillian. Somehow, she
convinced him to let us finish moving some of the items, but we had
to leave a good deal behind to make it seem that we weren’t actually
“moving out” but rather “moving some things around.” With our
pulses racing, we took Todd’s h alf- full truck out of the loading dock
and across Lake Washington to our new, tiny, bare- bones but s afe-
from- seizure office. We’d sacrificed a good dozen pieces of unwieldy
office furniture and some cheap supplies but felt lucky just to make it
out with our computers and essentials. The next week, the company
my mom had run for twenty- three years officially closed, and we
started a new business under a new name.
But though we’d moved and changed our name, we were far from
starting fresh. A couple of months later, that gold- chained debt col-
lector showed up, and I called my mom in a panic.
Even though the debt was being used for business purposes, the
creditors would be coming after me personally because it was my
signature and my social security number on the applications. Gillian
told me she’d try to take care of it. That was the first day I truly un-
derstood that most of the money our company owed was actually
money I owed personally.
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
It made sense. If Gillian had used her name and her credit to take
out even more of those equipment loans and l ow- interest credit cards,
she and my dad could be held liable for repayment, and she already
had some debt of her own. They could lose their assets and be forced
into bankruptcy. My grandmother could lose her house.
That evening, walking home from work, I started processing our
nerve- racking situation and my role in creating it. I’d willfully chosen
to ignore and not ask questions about the financial problems we were
in, ostensibly so I could concentrate on my part of the work but, in
honesty, because I didn’t want to deal with it. My mom could handle
it. That was her job, right? I was just the web design g uy. . . . That’s
what I’d told myself. But slowly I came around to the idea that stick-
ing my head in the sand about our debt in the hopes it would go away
was an untenable path.
When You’re in Debt to the Truth,
the Interest Rate Sucks
Considering the onslaught of “final notice” letters, threatening phone
calls, and the visit from gold- chains- and- chest- hair guy (let’s go with
“Rocco,” as he already fit every other debt- collector stereotype), the
logical move would have been to declare bankruptcy. Most of the debt
was in my name, a little was in Gillian’s, and, because we had de-
faulted on the bigger chunks in my name, the black marks I was rack-
ing up on my credit report were having a similar effect to a bankruptcy
(as of this writing, my creditworthiness is still in the toilet). But we
had another impediment.
During the four years we built up debt, we’d been lying.
We’d never told my dad, Scott (to whom my mom was, and re-
mains, married), that we had any financial problems, any outstanding
# LOST AND FOUNDER

loans, or any debt collectors breathing down our necks. We both
feared, rightly or wrongly, that if he found out, he’d divorce my mom
and break up our family.
It sounds too dysfunctional to be real, but this lie of omission
wasn’t without precedent. Growing up, my parents lied to each other
all the time— mostly about little stuff (or, at least, those are the only
things I knew about). Dad would say, “Don’t tell your mom we did
this” or, “If anyone asks, tell them you are only seven years old/ were
promised a discount/ were told by the staff it was okay.” Mom would
say, “If your father asks, tell him we used a coupon/ had to because of
your school/ went here on behalf of a client.”
These were mostly innocent lies, crafted in order to prevent an
altercation and keep relationships smooth. As an adult, reflecting on
these memories makes me realize how profoundly unhealthy the dy-
namic between my parents was, but as a child and teenager, it made
reasonable sense. The goal was to limit anyone getting angry or feel-
ing hurt or left out or ignored. We were lying to keep the peace and
maintain the veneer of a happy family unit.
That debt, however, was a much bigger lie than anything I’d ever
been part of. I remember Geraldine and I talking about it at the time
and for years after. We wondered how my mom could stand to be
around my dad, day after day, holding in this giant secret, rushing to
get home before him so she could shred any potentially incriminating
mail, pretending that the d ebt- collection calls were wrong numbers,
keeping up the appearance that things were fine at w ork— even bring-
ing home an occasional paycheck to make him think things were
okay when we probably should have used that money to stave off the
next bank that might sell our debt to collections.
Gillian, ostensibly to keep us from worrying and to help us focus
on our tasks, kept some of the details and progress of our struggle
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
against debt hidden from me at the time. It wasn’t until years later
that I learned how she managed to dodge some of the worst debt col-
lectors by proactively calling the issuers of the debt (Washington Mu-
tual, Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo), sharing the details of our
situation, and offering a smaller sum than what was owed in exchange
for the creditor writing off the debt rather than selling to collections.
Because a collections agency would typically pay the debt holder 5– 10
percent of the actual amount owed, then try to collect the full amount
and profit from the delta, my mom’s tactic was often successful.
While my credit report took the brunt of our debt problems, Gil-
lian bore the lion’s share of the stress. She’d always taken care of our
finances and transactions. Despite having more than half a dozen
credit accounts with various companies, I never even looked at the
invoices— I passed them to my mom and went back to designing web-
sites. I knew things were bad, but I rarely asked for updates. I just went
about my work, hoping beyond hope that we could somehow land
enough contracts and make enough money to pay back what we owed.
Later, I’d hear stories of other small businesses and startups that
faced similar situations. Although I wish it were true that cofounders
and family business owners and small teams were always honest with
one another, that’s often not the case. Tinder grew to dominate the
world of online dating apps, but behind the scenes, cofounder strife,
political struggles, and outright sexism led to lawsuits, stunted growth,
and power struggles. Zipcar, one of the fastest- growing players in al-
ternative transportation, lost both its cofounders over years of poli-
ticking, infighting, and fundraising struggles. Twitter famously lost
nearly all of its founding team. Facebook’s cofounder, Eduardo Sav-
erin, helped write a movie (The Social Network, released 2010) about
his ouster. Despite these a ll- too- common conflicts, many businesses
don’t collapse; they find ways of coping, carrying on, and working
# LOST AND FOUNDER

through or around poor communication, dishonesty, and dozens of
other challenging problems people in h igh- stakes relationships face.
And that’s what we did.
Transparency Is Hard, but It Works
There will never be a shortage of justifications for why you believe
hiding the truth is the right path. You’re worried about hurting some-
one’s feelings. You’re afraid if your customers find out about a prob-
lem, they’ll leave your service forever. You’re convinced that you’re
actually protecting your executive team from stress by redacting de-
tails of your investor meetings. You believe the competition probably
has engineers idly waiting for some sign of how you’ve built your
amazing technology so they can instantly replicate it and launch be-
fore you have the chance.
So you keep secrets. You distort the truth. You tell a few lies. And
worst, you think you can get away with it.
Later, when reality comes crashing down (as it always does), you
lose the faith of your team or your audience, your investors or your
customers. But you justify it by telling yourself: “If things had only
gone another way, no one would have even found out, and everything
would have been fine.”
I have to assume that’s what Travis Kalanick thought about his vis-
its to Korean escort parlors with the Uber executive team. And what
Facebook thought about testing whether showing particular posts could
influence people’s moods. It’s surely what Steve Ballmer believed about
his infamous abusive tantrums at Microsoft leadership meetings. And
it’s undoubtedly why Tinder’s CEO thought he could sexually harass
and bully cofounder Whitney Wolfe. When people believe they can hide
the truth, many of the incentives inhibiting bad behavior fall apart.
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
Every founder, every investor, and certainly every employee I’ve
ever talked to in the startup world has stories about the secrets
that eventually got out, costing trust, harming relationships, and of-
ten affecting revenue and growth, too. But there’s another way—
transparency. Transparency is making the choice to reveal even the
most uncomfortable truths with relentless candor.
Transparency isn’t the same as honesty. Honesty is saying only
things that are true. Many founders and startup teams are honest (in
that they don’t directly lie). But transparency requires digging deep to
find and expose what others would normally leave unsaid and refus-
ing to take the easy, quiet road. It’s tackling the conversations that
make your stomach turn and your voice get caught in your throat.
And like nearly everything in the world of startups, swallowing the
bitter pill now is vastly superior to letting the disease of opacity fester.
If there’s an underperforming person on your team, it’s easy to
ignore him for a while and hope his manager either helps him im-
prove or fires him. It’s much harder and more uncomfortable to
thoughtfully process why you’re unhappy with him, document in-
stances of unwanted behavior, have a direct conversation with the
team member, and, if necessary, coach him or work to find mentor-
ship/ coaching/ classes (whatever it takes to give him the tools to get
better if he has the desire). It could still end up that you (or his man-
ager) may have to ultimately fire him. That’s the thing with transpar-
ency: sometimes, the outcome is the same, but how you got there, and
the downside risk, is remarkably different.
Say you’re six months away from layoffs given your current reve-
nue, expenses, and projections. You can be honest by simply remain-
ing silent and imploring your team to improve the growth rate. Or
you can be transparent by sharing your financials and your projec-
tions and explaining exactly what you need to do between now and
# LOST AND FOUNDER

month 6 to avoid cutting the team. Nine out of ten leadership teams
won’t share that information. They’ll fear, perhaps rightly, that team
members might start looking for new jobs or leak numbers to the
press. But what happens when those layoffs hit? Y eah . . . your team
will stop trusting you. They’ll no longer believe that things are going
“fine” when you say so. They’ll always be looking for signs that the
next crisis is around the corner. Those team members you hoped
wouldn’t look for new jobs— trust me, they’re far less likely to stay
than if you’d been up front.
Transparency’s harder at first, and it feels especially painful when
it reveals your mistakes or challenges the image you’ve crafted for your
team or customers. Yet, it’s immensely powerful, and it has an almost
unbelievably positive impact on everyone around you.
Kim Scott, in her book Radical Candor, frames this concept in
terms of a matrix:
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
She outlines one of the most important things to remember when
it comes to transparency: you need to balance it with empathy. If I tell
you I hate your haircut, I’m being transparent. I’m also being an asshole.
If your funding discussions are not going well, it’s easy to hold out
hope, tell your team you’re still “in the process,” and only if/ when the
last investor backs out or the money in the bank runs dry do you let
everyone know that cost cutting and layoffs are happening. Far more
uncomfortable, but vastly more transparent, is to give regular status
updates on the fundraising process internally so employees and exec-
utives know precisely what investors are saying, why the pitch isn’t
working, and where the business metrics are perceived to be weak
and can then anticipate a realistic future and potentially contribute to
a better result. It may feel like telling your team is admitting weakness
and defeat, but in fact, you’ll build camaraderie, support, and a pow-
erful incentive to do remarkable work. I’ve been blown away, time and
again, by the ability that “bad news” has to catalyze great effort and
remarkable results.
But I can’t do that! My team will freak out!
You’d be surprised at how people rise to a challenge once they
know that there is a challenge. And don’t kid yourself— you may think
you’re keeping them safe by keeping them in the dark, but some dis-
torted version of the truth always leaks. Misinformation stokes fear
and resentment in your team. That’s never good for business— or for
anyone’s well- being. You need your team’s trust, not just in that one
moment when fundraising’s going poorly or growth has stalled, but
in the long term. Even after people leave, what they say about you and
your trustworthiness will affect basic business functions like recruit-
ing, sales, branding, and bizdev for decades to come.
The most meaningful benefit transparency brings might be its
# LOST AND FOUNDER

forcing function for deliberately ethical, rational behavior. As CEO,
I’d often tell my executives and board that every email should be writ-
ten and every conversation conducted as though it will one day be
leaked. We should be proud, not embarrassed, by what and how we
communicate, even when the doors are closed. There are good rea-
sons for privacy— to avoid shaming an employee for a mistake or to
enable discussion about private, personal, or professional issues (among
others). But people change their behavior for the better when they as-
sume their peers, their reports, and their leadership will get to see/ hear
the full story.
Transparency can’t just be a tactic, though. It has to be a core
value that’s consistently followed. If you openly share some things,
but hide others, credibility will suffer. Your team will always wonder
what you’re not sharing. Your customers, your investors, the press—
whomever you interact with— will be trained to mistrust you. A rep-
utation for caginess lasts a long time and follows you across companies
and geographies.
When we adopted transparency as a core value at Moz, it wasn’t
always easy, and we didn’t always live up to the ideal. But more than
any other aspect of the company, transparency, and the trustworthi-
ness it instilled in our team, our community, and our customers built
the company’s legacy. We shared our financials online (just as I have
in this book). We wrote about our product struggles, our fundraising
failures, our most difficult internal conversations, our strategy. We
were called crazy and foolish for oversharing so much about the me-
chanics of the business. But we also became trusted, and, especially
because the field of SEO and the broader world of tech startups are so
often impenetrably secretive, it paid off.
Early in my career, I was deeply afraid of being transparent. I feared
if our customers knew the truth about our tiny operation, or about my
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE (FROM A LOT OF $#*% STORMS )
age and inexperience, they wouldn’t want to work with us. Of course,
when we signed a new client, inevitably we’d meet, or they’d search for
me and find those things out anyway. I was scared like hell to admit I
didn’t know how some aspect of HTML worked, but by faking it, I outed
my lack of knowledge even more blatantly. My mom and I covering up
our debts and our missteps— hiding that risk from my dad? It only
caused more stress and fear. Had we been honest from the start, he
could have helped, could have saved us the hundreds of thousands in
interest penalties we ended up owing. Instead, we created a nightmare
of secrecy that nearly ended in professional and personal disaster.
Of course, years later, he did learn the truth. I heard about it from
my younger brother, Evan, who told the story this way:
“Dad found out about the debt. Mom tried to play it off, but he
found out. I went to my room and put on headphones, but he yelled so
loud, the house was shaking.”
My only consolation: my dad and I weren’t speaking at the time.
We’ve probably had three conversations in the last seven years. Secrets,
lies, o pacity— they tear families apart just as surely as they do startups.
My credit still sucks. My relationship with my parents remains
rough. But I don’t get any more unexpected visits from debt collectors
who look like they could b ench- press me. At least I can put that in the
win column.
If we’d been transparent from the start, I believe we’d be in a
different, better place today. The only solace is that this lesson, hard
won through regret and carried forward in my personal and profes-
sional life, helped, over the next decade, to make Moz into something
truly special. If you ask me why I’m so open, so bluntly honest about
things that the startup ecosystem and business culture usually urge
us to keep silent, this is why. I’m done with the pain of secrecy, happy
to trade it for the challenges transparency brings.
